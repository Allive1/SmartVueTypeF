Create a transition instance from a resource file

This technique enables you to modify your transition definition without 
having to change the code of your activity. This technique is also useful 
to separate complex transition definitions from your application code, 
as shown in Specify Multiple Transitions.

To specify a built-in transition in a resource file, follow these steps:

Add the res/transition/ directory to your project.
Create a new XML resource file inside this directory.
Add an XML node for one of the built-in transitions.
