Apply a Transition
You typically apply a transition to change between different view hierarchies 
in response to an event, such as a user action. For example, consider a search 
app: when the user enters a search term and clicks the search button, the app 
changes to the scene that represents the results layout while applying a 
transition that fades out the search button and fades in the search results.

To make a scene change while applying a transition in response to some event 
in your activity, call the TransitionManager.go() static method with the ending 
scene and the transition instance to use for the animation, as shown in 
the following snippet:
